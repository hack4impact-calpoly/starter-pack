        Version Control
      </h1>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Learn about Version Control Systems</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Version Control</h2>
      <p>A version control system is a way to keep track of the changes to a file or a set of files. You can think
        of version control like save states in a video game or data backups. Programmers use version control in order to
        keep track of changes to our source code. This allows us to compare changes to code over time, revert to older
        versions of code easily, experiment or iterate safely without fear of critical errors, and, when collaborating,
        know who made what changes.</p>
      <p class="note">Version control is also known as source control or source code management.</p>
      <h2>Local Version Control</h2>
      <p>If you have ever saved a copy of a file before making changes, you've used a local version control
        system. Keeping track of files this way is simple, but very error prone. Early local VCSs instead kept a
        database, called a repository, of revisions and differences between files. This type of version
        control is called <strong>Delta-based</strong> version control.</p>

        subgraph local [local computer]
        direction LR
        subgraph database [database]
        direction TB
        v1[version 1]
        v2[version 2]
        v3[version 3]
        v3---v2---v1
        end
        f[file]
        f---database
        end
        classDef node font-family:monospace,font-size:14px
        classDef clusters font-family:monospace,font-size:14px
        classDef cluster rx:5px,ry:5px
      </pre>
      <p> For example, let's say you have
        a file with some text.</p>
      <h3 class="file-heading"><em>file.txt @ (2023-01-01 13:30:25)</em></h3>
      <pre class="file">I am doing the Starter Pack!
I like Hack4Impact!</pre>
      <p>Later, you make some changes to the file.</p>
      <h3 class="file-heading"><em>file.txt @ (2023-01-02 12:40:36)</em></h3>
      <pre class="file">I am done with the Starter Pack!
I love Hack4Impact!</pre>
      <p>A Delta-based VCS would keep track of what you <del>deleted</del> or <ins>added</ins>.
        Then, by adding up all the differences, versions of files saved at any point in time could be recreated.</p>
      <h3 class="file-heading"><em>file.txt</em></h3>
      <pre class="file"><del>I am doing the Starter Pack!</del>
<ins>I am done with the Starter Pack!</ins>
I <del>like</del><ins>love</ins> Hack4Impact!</pre>
      <p class="note">What are some easy errors that could happen if your local version control system was copying files
        as backups?</p>
      <h2>Centralized Version Control</h2>
      <p>But what good is local version control if you want to collaborate with other developers? Enter, a centralized
        version control system (CVCS). In a centralized version control system, an online server hosts the
        <strong>repository</strong>. Individual developers would <em>check out</em> versions of files from the server to
        their systems.
      </p>
      <p>This system was the standard of version control for many years and is still used today, however there are some
        inherent risks with relying on a single database of your entire project.</p>

        v2[version 2]
        v3[version 3]
        v3---v2---v1
        end
        end
        subgraph cpa [computer a]
        direction LR
        fa[file]
        end
        subgraph cpb [computer b]
        direction LR
        fb[file]
        end

        classDef clusters font-family:monospace,font-size:14px
        classDef cluster rx:5px,ry:5px
      </pre>
      <p class="note">What is the major risk of using a centralized version control system?</p>
      <h2>Distributed Version Control</h2>
      <p>Hence, the distributed version control system (DVCS). In a DVCS, every developer <em>clones</em> the entire
        repository
        from the online server. In the case of server death, each clone of the repository is a full backup of the
        project files and the database containing the differences between past versions.</p>
