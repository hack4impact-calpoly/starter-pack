      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Learn about HyperText Markup Language (HTML)</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>HTML</h2>
      <p> We'll come back to Git in a little bit, but for now let's learn about the <strong>HyperText Markup
          Language</strong>. <strong>HTML</strong> is one half of what makes up a static website. If
        <strong>CSS</strong> is the pretty neon lights and <strong>JavaScript</strong> is the flashing patterns and
        programmed functionality, HTML is all the wiring and framework underneath. HTML is the foundation and structure for
        <em>all</em> web applications.
      </p>
      <p>It may sound intimidating, but HTML is just text with some fancy
        formatting features. In fact, all you need to start writing HTML is a text editor.</p>
      <p> You could write it in Word or Google Docs or Notepad if you really want the <em>raw</em> experience. We'll be
        using Visual Studio Code for comfort and ease of use.</p>
      <h2>Write Some HTML</h2>
      <p>Open the file called <code>index.html</code> that you created before and add the the following.</p>
      <h3 class="file-heading"><em>index.html</em></h3>
      <pre class="file"><code class="language-html">Hello World! This is my website.</code></pre>
      <h2>View Your HTML</h2>
      <video class="video" controls>
        <source src="assets/1501.mp4" type="video/mp4">
      </video>
      <p>To see your spiffy new website, open a browser and type in the file path of your file. For
        example: <code>/Users/hack4impact/hack4impact-calpoly.github.io/index.html</code> on macOs.</p>
      <p>You can also go into your File Explorer or Finder and open the file from there. Or, go to the menu bar of
        your browser and under <strong>File</strong> &gt <strong>Open File...</strong></p>
      <p>Congrats! You've made and opened your first HTML webpage.</p>
      <h2>Don't Forget...</h2>
      <p>Remember, we're still working in a version controlled directory. Go ahead and stage then commit your latest
        changes. Follow the conventional commit message guidelines from Lab 10 and best practices for <code>Git</code>.
      </p>
      <p>The more frequently you commit the better. We'll be looking for good commit histories. We believe in you. :)
