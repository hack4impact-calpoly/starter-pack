        Tables and Forms
      </h1>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Learn about tables and forms in HTML</li>
        <li>
          Add a <code class="language-html">&lt;form&gt;</code> to your personal website
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Tables</h2>
      <p>In the early days of the Internet, tables were
        used to layout the pages. Now that we can use CSS, tables are mainly for displaying tabular data.
        Imagine an Excel or Google Sheets table and the kind of information you would display there.
        Tables have a <strong>table</strong> definition, <strong>table row</strong>, and <strong>table data</strong>
        cells. Respectively, these are <code class="language-html">&lt;table&gt;</code>, <code
          class="language-html">&lt;tr&gt;</code>, and <code class="language-html">&lt;td&gt;</code>.</p>
      <p>The following is the structure for a 3 x 4 table. It defines the table and gives it 4 table rows each of which
        have 3 table data cells.</p>
      <h3 class="file-heading"><em>table.html</em></h3>
      <div class="side-by-side-container">
        <div class="side-by-side-child">
          <pre class="file line-numbers" data-range="7,33" data-src="prism/html/2301.html"></pre>
        </div>
        <div class="side-by-side-child">
          <iframe class="iframe-full file" src="prism/html/2301.html"></iframe>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>As you can see, the HTML definition of the table only positions the elements in place and doesn't provide any
        styling, borders or colors, that you would expect table in a traditional spreadsheet program. Worry not,
        when we learn about styling we'll learn how to add those features to our tables.</p>
      <h2>Forms</h2>
      <p>The final HTML tag we will cover is <em>forms</em>. Forms are important all across the internet because we want
        users to be able to interact with our website and not just look at it! Coding a form in just HTML won't be much
        use to us though.</p>
      <p>Now that you have more experience in HTML, take a look at the following code examples for forms and see if you
        can understand what each tag and attribute is doing. Try typing into the fields.</p>
      <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The <code>id</code> attribute is like <code>class</code> except it can only
        be applied to one tag on each page. Usually used for unique items per page.</p>
      <h3 class="file-heading"><em>form.html</em></h3>
      <div class="side-by-side-container">
        <div class="side-by-side-child">
          <pre class="file line-numbers" data-range="8,39" data-src="prism/html/2302.html"></pre>
        </div>
        <div class="side-by-side-child">
          <iframe class="iframe-full file" src="prism/html/2302.html"></iframe>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Other <code>type</code> of <code class="language-html">&lt;input&gt;</code>
        include <code>"radio"</code> and <code>"checkbox"</code>. What do you think those inputs look like?
        Try experimenting with changing the <code>type</code> to them.</p>
      <p>If you remember back to Lab 15, HTML only provides the <strong>semantics</strong>
        or meaning of a webpage and not its appearance <em>or</em> its function. This separation of powers helps to keep your code nice
        and neat, but it also means that our forms won't function without the programming run it.</p>
