      <h2>
        Expectations
      </h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Do your best!</strong> A lot of effort and care was put into developing the Starter Pack and we would
        like you to do the same when going through it. It can be tempting to copy and paste code, use AI, or skim
        through the labs, but we encourage you to resist those temptations. You will get the most out of the Starter
        Pack if you put in the effort.
      </p>
      <p>
        You have one week from when you receive the Starter Pack to complete it. If you are unable to complete it in that
        time, let us know sooner rather than later and we can work something out. Remember to schedule an interview as
        well! There's a link on the home page of the Starter Pack.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you get stuck, we <i>highly</i> encourage you to ask for help! It's really important to us you learn and
        get something out of the process. You can ask for help by posting on GitHub Discussions or messaging one of
        the Hack4Impact Engineering members.
      </p>
      <p>Help others! If you see someone asking a question you know the answer to, give them some help.</p>
      <h2>
        Tips & Tricks
      </h2>
      <p>
        Here are some tips & tricks to keep in mind as you go through the Starter Pack:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The Starter Pack assumes you know nothing about coding. You are free to progress as slow or as quick as you
          would like, but even if you have experience we still recommend you do each lab. You might learn something new!
        </li>
        <li>
          Each lab builds on the previous one, so it's important to go in order. Use the next and previous buttons to
          change between labs. Or use the navigation bar on the left.
        </li>
        <li>
          Engage with the content! There will be opportunity throughout the project to add your own flair. We encourage
          you to do so and make your website your own!
