        Tracking Branches
      </h1>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Learn how to track a <code>Git</code> branch remotely</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Branches</h2>
      <p>Now that we're connected, we have to <em>track our branch</em>. Much like how we had to track our files when we
        first
        add them, when we first connect to a remote repository, we have to track the <strong>branch</strong> we're on.
      </p>
      <p>If <code class="language-git">git commits</code> are a way to keep track of the changes to your code over time,
        <em>branches</em> are a way to keep track of different versions of your code. Every <code>Git</code> repository
        has a <strong>main</strong> branch and can be represented as a series of commits with their hash-values
        attached.
      </p>
      <pre class="mermaid">
        gitGraph
        commit
        commit
        commit
        commit
        commit
      </pre>
      <p>Let's say we have a new feature we want to add to our website. However, we don't want to mess with the code we
        currently have.
        We can create a new branch for this new feature.</p>
      <pre class="mermaid">
        gitGraph
        commit
        commit
        commit
        commit
        commit
        branch develop
        checkout develop
      </pre>
      <p>This new branch would reference the <strong>main</strong> branch from when it was created. We could make all
        our changes for the new feature on this new branch.
      </p>
      <pre class="mermaid">
        gitGraph
        commit
        commit
        commit
        commit
        commit
        branch develop
        checkout develop
        commit
        commit
        commit
      </pre>
      <p>When done, we could <strong>merge</strong> our changes from our developing branch back into our main branch.
      </p>
      <pre class="mermaid">
        gitGraph
        commit
        commit
        commit
        commit
        commit
        branch develop
        checkout develop
        commit
        commit
        commit
        checkout main
        merge develop
      </pre>
      <p>Branches are often used when multiple people are collaborating on a project's repository. It can get pretty
        complicated pretty quickly. For example, in the <code>git graph</code> below. Don't worry about understanding
        it all now. You'll get better as you use <code>Git</code> branches more.
      </p>
      <pre class="mermaid">
        gitGraph
        commit
        commit
        branch test
        checkout test
        commit
        checkout main
        commit
        commit
        commit
        branch develop
        checkout develop
        commit
        commit
        commit
        checkout main
        commit
        commit
        branch feature
        checkout feature
        commit
        commit
        commit
        checkout main
        merge develop
        commit
        merge feature
      </pre>
      <h2>Track Our Branch</h2>
      <p>First, let's rename our branch to <code>main</code>.</p>
      <h3><b>Execute</b></h3>
      <pre class="command-line" data-prompt="$"><code class="language-git">git branch -M main</code></pre>
      <p>Then we'll track our branch using the following command.</p>
      <h3><b>Execute</b></h3>
      <pre class="command-line" data-prompt="$"><code class="language-git">git push -u origin main</code></pre>
      <p class="note"><code>-u</code> is short for <code>--set-upstream</code>. If you ever see that, it means the
      same thing and that you need to track your local branch remotely.</p>
      <h3><b>Output</b></h3>
      <pre class="command-line" data-prompt="$" data-filter-output="(out)"><code class="language-git">git push -u origin main

      <p>You should see something similar to above. 
      Now if you go to the repository on GitHub, you should see all your local files uploaded to the remote repository!</p>

<p>Double check that everything went well on your remote repository. You should see the new link in your <code>README.md</code>. If not, review
the instructions and the last few labs.</p>
