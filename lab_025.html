        Semantic HTML
      </h1>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Review the takeaways of semantic HTML</li>
        <li>Create your first GitHub repository and host your HTML website</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Structure, not Style</h2>
      <p>Now that you've created an entire website in HTML, the <em>key idea</em> you should remember is that HTML
        should not be used just to make pages look a certain way, but to also reinforce their <strong>meaning</strong>
        or
        <strong>semantics</strong>. Whenever possible, use tags that make logical sense and that provide a richer,
        clearer idea of what the role of certain components or content are.
      </p>
      <p>You could accomplish all same things as <code class="language-html">&lt;header&gt;</code> , <code
          class="language-html">&lt;nav&gt;</code> , <code class="language-html">&lt;body&gt;</code> and <code
          class="language-html">&lt;footer&gt;</code> with just <code class="language-html">&lt;div&gt;</code>, but it
        would be a less meaningful and more confusing structure to understand.</p>
      <p>Used correctly, semantic HTML webpages are understandable solely from their HTML structure,
        improving accessibility. <em>And</em> they are more share-able and search-able across many different
        platforms, increasing discover-ability and their impact.
      </p>
      <h2>GitHub Repository</h2>
      <p>Speaking of discover-ability, so far you have been working and accessing your page on your own browser and
        local system. However, the whole point of a website is for people to visit it. You also have a log
        of your coding history in your local <code>Git</code> repository. Local repositories are hard to access on other
        computers and susceptible to disappearing forever if your computer dies.</p>
      <p>It's time to connect your <em>local repositoyr</em> to a <strong>remote repository</strong> on GitHub. This
        will serve the dual purpose of hosting your local repository in more resilient servers and also make use of a
        GitHub feature called <strong>GitHub pages</strong> which lets you host your own website for free!</p>
